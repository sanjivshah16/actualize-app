      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Using \"When\" clearly introduces the time-related clause and sets up the context for what follows. The original phrase \"At first\" incorrectly suggests a contrast or sequence of events, but the sentence isn't comparing two points in time or showing a shift; it's simply stating what happened at the time the restaurant opened. Options A, B, and D are either misleading or grammatically incomplete, while C correctly and clearly introduces the time clause.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Em dashes are appropriate when inserting a break or interruption for emphasis, and here they neatly isolate the list of unusual ingredients, giving it the right emphasis without disrupting the sentence flow. Choice A (the original) is incorrect because the comma after \"ingredients\" followed by \"such as,\" and then another comma after \"manioc root\" is unnecessary and awkward. Choice C lacks proper punctuation altogether, making the phrase confusing and grammatically incomplete. Choice D incorrectly adds a comma before \"manioc root\" and another after it, which makes it choppy and unclear.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The word \"thrilled\" clearly conveys a strong, positive emotional reaction, which aligns perfectly with the writer's goal of emphasizing how much diners have enjoyed the experience. The other choices—\"mystified,\" \"shocked,\" and \"startled\"—are more neutral or even negative in tone. \"Mystified\" suggests confusion or wonder, which doesn't clearly indicate a positive feeling. \"Shocked\" and \"startled\" both carry negative or jarring connotations and don't fit the positive context of the sentence. \"Thrilled\" directly supports the idea of diners having a joyful, enthusiastic response.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The phrase \"Still, Atala felt he could do more for his country and its cuisine\" works well as a transition because it builds directly on the previous paragraph's focus on Atala's success with his restaurant. The word \"Still\" signals a shift—it shows that even though Atala had achieved great things, he wasn't done yet. This leads logically into the next paragraph, which discusses how he went on to found Instituto Atá and further contribute to Brazil's culinary and environmental landscape. The other options, while accurate, are too specific or unrelated to the flow of the paragraph.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The sentence is describing the tree dying once its (possessive) heart is removed, and \"its\" is the proper pronoun for showing ownership. Choice B uses \"their,\" which is plural and doesn't match the singular subject \"tree.\" Choice C incorrectly makes the subject plural (\"trees\") and still uses \"its,\" creating disagreement. Choice D uses \"it's,\" which is a contraction for \"it is\" or \"it has,\" and is incorrect in this possessive context. Therefore, \"its\" in the original sentence is grammatically correct.",

      "explanation": "This wording is formal, neutral, and consistent with the informative and respectful tone of the essay. The passage discusses sustainability and environmental responsibility in a serious and objective style, and \"live to yield\" fits that tone perfectly. The other choices—\"pull through and spawn,\" \"continue to churn out,\" and \"keep doling out\"—are too casual or informal. \"Pull through and spawn\" sounds overly dramatic and biological, \"churn out\" implies mass production and lacks sensitivity, and \"dole out\" has a somewhat dismissive or mechanical tone.",

The original phrase \"know-how they have\" is vague and repetitive, since \"know-how\" already implies knowledge that someone possesses. Option B is overly wordy and repeats the idea of knowledge and knowing in an awkward way. Option C adds an unnecessary phrase \"in the area,\" which is implied by the term \"local plants.\" Only option D communicates the intended meaning efficiently and clearly, avoiding redundancy while staying on topic.",

The sentence begins, \"Partnering with Instituto Atá…\" and refers to a singular action that has had an effect, so the correct verb form is the singular present perfect tense \"has enabled.\" The original \"have enabled\" is incorrect because \"have\" is plural and doesn't agree with the singular subject.
