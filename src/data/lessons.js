# ACT English: General Strategy

## Overview
The ACT English section tests your knowledge of standard written English, including grammar, punctuation, and rhetorical skills.

**Enhanced ACT (2025+):** 50 questions in 35 minutes
**Legacy ACT:** 75 questions in 45 minutes

## The Two Categories

### Category 1: Grammar & Mechanics (60-70%)
- Comma usage
- Subject-verb agreement
- Pronoun agreement
- Punctuation
- Sentence structure

### Category 2 & 3: Rhetorical Skills (30-40%)
- **Cat 2 (Edit for Meaning):** Word choice, transitions, sentence placement
- **Cat 3 (Comment for Meaning):** Author's purpose, adding/deleting content

## Key Strategies

### 1. Read the Full Sentence
Always read the entire sentence containing the underlined portion. Context is crucial.

### 2. Economy Rule
**Shorter is usually better** on the ACT—but check for:
- Agreement errors
- Missing essential meaning
- Clarity issues

### 3. NO CHANGE is Valid
About 25% of answers are "NO CHANGE." Don't be afraid to select it if the original is correct.

### 4. Trust Your Ear (Sometimes)
If something sounds wrong, it often is. But verify with rules—your ear can be tricked!

# Essential ACT Math Formulas

## Algebra

### Linear Equations
- Slope: m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)
- Slope-intercept form: y = mx + b
- Point-slope form: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)

### Quadratic Equations
- Standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0
- Quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
- Vertex form: y = a(x - h)² + k, vertex at (h, k)

## Geometry

### Triangles
- Area = (1/2) × base × height
- Pythagorean Theorem: a² + b² = c²
- Sum of angles = 180°

### Circles
- Area = πr²
- Circumference = 2πr = πd
- Arc length = (θ/360°) × 2πr

### Volume
- Cylinder: V = πr²h
- Rectangular prism: V = lwh
- Cone: V = (1/3)πr²h

## Trigonometry (SOHCAHTOA)
- sin(θ) = Opposite / Hypotenuse
- cos(θ) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse
- tan(θ) = Opposite / Adjacent

## Statistics
- Mean = Sum of values / Number of values
- Median = Middle value (when ordered)
- Mode = Most frequent value

# ACT Reading: General Strategy

## Section Overview
**Enhanced ACT:** 36 questions, 40 minutes (~1 min per question)
**Legacy ACT:** 40 questions, 35 minutes (~52 sec per question)

4 passages: Prose Fiction/Literary Narrative, Social Science, Humanities, Natural Science

## Reading Strategy Options

### Option 1: Read Then Answer
1. Read passage carefully (3-4 minutes)
2. Answer questions (4-5 minutes)
**Best for:** Strong readers who retain information

### Option 2: Skim Then Answer
1. Skim for main ideas (2 minutes)
2. Return to passage for specific questions
**Best for:** Slower readers, detail-oriented questions

### Option 3: Questions First
1. Read questions first
2. Search passage for answers
**Best for:** Very fast scanners

## Question Attack Strategy

### Line Numbers First
When a question references specific lines, go there IMMEDIATELY.

### Elimination is Key
Wrong answers are often:
- Too extreme
- Not supported by text
- Only partially correct
- From wrong part of passage

### General > Specific
For main idea questions, avoid overly specific answers.

### Positive > Negative
When in doubt, prefer positive/neutral tone over negative.

# ACT Science: General Strategy

## Section Overview
**Enhanced ACT:** 40 questions, 40 minutes (optional for composite)
**Legacy ACT:** 40 questions, 35 minutes

6-7 passages with tables, graphs, and experiments

## The Truth About ACT Science

**You don't need to know science!**

ACT Science is really a reading comprehension test disguised as science. You're tested on:
- Interpreting data in tables and graphs
- Understanding experimental design
- Analyzing conflicting viewpoints

## Question Categories

### 1. Data Questions (40-50%)
Find specific values in tables/graphs.
- "According to Figure 1..."
- Go directly to the data source

### 2. Bridge Questions (25-35%)
Combine information from multiple sources.
- "Based on Table 1 AND Figure 2..."
- Identify the linking variable

### 3. Big Picture Questions (10-15%)
Require understanding the overall experiment.
- "Which hypothesis is supported?"
- Understand the experimental setup

## Key Strategies

### Don't Read the Passage First
Skip the intro paragraphs. Go straight to:
1. Questions
2. Figures/Tables
3. Only read text when needed

### Label Your Variables
Write what each axis/column represents.

### Trends Over Values
Focus on patterns: increasing, decreasing, no change.

    title: 'Comma Rules Deep Dive',
    section: 'english',
    duration: 35,
    content: `
# Mastering Comma Questions

Comma questions make up 15-20% of the English section. Master these rules!

## Rule 1: FANBOYS (Compound Sentences)
Use a comma before FANBOYS when joining two independent clauses.

**For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So**

✓ "I studied hard, and I passed the test."
✗ "I studied hard, and passed the test." (no comma—"passed" isn't a clause)

## Rule 2: Introductory Elements
Use a comma after introductory words, phrases, or clauses.

✓ "However, the plan failed."
✓ "After the long meeting, everyone was tired."
✓ "Running to catch the bus, she dropped her phone."

## Rule 3: Nonessential Clauses
Set off nonessential (nonrestrictive) information with commas.

**The Bracket Test:** Can you remove it without losing essential meaning?

✓ "My brother, who lives in Texas, is visiting." (nonessential—which brother is clear)
✗ "People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones." (essential—defines which people)

## Rule 4: Lists
Use commas between three or more items. ACT uses the Oxford comma.

✓ "I bought apples, oranges, and bananas."

## Rule 5: Coordinate Adjectives
Use commas between adjectives that could be joined by "and."

✓ "The tall, dark stranger" (tall AND dark works)
✗ "The old brick house" (old AND brick doesn't work naturally)

## The D&I Test
Test if a comma creates a **D**ependent + **I**ndependent split:
- Before the comma: Can it stand alone?
- After the comma: Can it stand alone?
- If BOTH can → comma + FANBOYS or semicolon
- If only ONE can → no comma (usually)

# ACT Math: Geometry

Geometry questions make up about 20-25% of the ACT Math section.

## Triangles

### Key Properties
- Sum of interior angles = 180°
- Exterior angle = Sum of non-adjacent interior angles
- Longest side is opposite the largest angle

### Special Triangles
**30-60-90:** sides in ratio 1 : √3 : 2
**45-45-90:** sides in ratio 1 : 1 : √2

### Pythagorean Triples
Memorize these common ratios:
- 3-4-5 (and multiples: 6-8-10, 9-12-15)
- 5-12-13
- 8-15-17
- 7-24-25

## Circles

### Key Formulas
- Area = πr²
- Circumference = 2πr = πd
- Arc length = (θ/360°) × 2πr
- Sector area = (θ/360°) × πr²

### Circle Theorems
- Inscribed angle = (1/2) central angle
- Tangent line is perpendicular to radius at point of tangency
- Two tangents from same external point are equal

## Coordinate Geometry

### Distance Formula
d = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]

### Midpoint Formula
M = ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2)

### Parallel & Perpendicular Lines
- Parallel lines have SAME slope
- Perpendicular lines have NEGATIVE RECIPROCAL slopes (m × m₂ = -1)

# English Section: Magic Tricks

These patterns appear repeatedly on the ACT. Learn them!

## 1. The Dash Rule
Dashes come in PAIRS unless at the end of a sentence.

✓ "The dog—a golden retriever—ran away."
✓ "She finally arrived—exhausted but happy."

**Test:** If you see one dash mid-sentence, look for its pair. If there's no pair, the answer is likely wrong.

## 2. The 3-and-1 Rule
When 3 answers share a feature and 1 is different, the different one is often correct.

**Example:**
A) quickly and efficiently moving
B) moving quickly and efficiently
C) moving with quickness and efficiency
D) moving efficiently and quickly

Three options start with "moving" → Choose a different structure (A)

## 3. The DELETE Rule
When "DELETE the underlined portion" is an option, give it serious consideration.

**DELETE is often correct when:**
- The underlined portion is redundant
- It repeats information already stated
- The sentence works perfectly without it

## 4. The Who/Whom Rule
- WHO = subject (he, she, they)
- WHOM = object (him, her, them)

**Quick Test:** Substitute he/him:
- "Who/Whom wrote this?" → "He wrote this" → WHO
- "To who/whom should I send this?" → "Send to him" → WHOM

## 5. The Colon Rule
Colons require a complete sentence BEFORE them.

✓ "I need three things: paper, pen, and patience."
✗ "I need: paper, pen, and patience."

# Category 2: Edit for Meaning Questions (EMQs)

Category 2 questions test your ability to improve the effectiveness of writing.

## Question Types

### 1. Transition Questions
Choose the word/phrase that best connects ideas.

**Strategy:**
1. Determine the relationship (contrast? addition? cause-effect?)
2. Eliminate options that don't match
3. Choose the most precise transition

**Relationships:**
- Contrast: however, nevertheless, although, despite
- Addition: furthermore, moreover, also, additionally
- Cause-Effect: therefore, consequently, thus, as a result

### 2. Word Choice Questions
Select the most appropriate word for context.

**Consider:**
- Tone (formal vs. casual)
- Precision (vague vs. specific)
- Connotation (positive vs. negative)

### 3. Sentence Placement Questions
"For the sake of logic, Sentence X should be placed..."

**Strategy:**
1. Read the sentence carefully
2. Identify transition words or references
3. Find where it logically fits (after what it references)

### 4. NOT/EXCEPT Questions
"All of the following would be acceptable EXCEPT..."

**Strategy:**
1. Test each answer individually
2. Mark answers as ✓ (acceptable) or ✗ (not acceptable)
3. The EXCEPT answer is the one that doesn't work

**Tip:** These questions often test comma rules or word choice.

    duration: 35,
    content: `
# Agreement Rules

Agreement errors are among the most common on the ACT.

## Subject-Verb Agreement

### Rule 1: Ignore Prepositional Phrases
The subject is NEVER in a prepositional phrase.

✓ "The box of chocolates IS delicious." (box is singular)
✓ "The students in the class ARE working." (students is plural)

**Common prepositions:** of, in, with, at, by, from, to, for, on, between, among

### Rule 2: Compound Subjects
- Subjects joined by AND = plural verb
- Subjects joined by OR/NOR = verb agrees with closer subject

✓ "The dog and cat ARE playing."
✓ "Neither the teacher nor the students WERE ready."

### Rule 3: Indefinite Pronouns

**Always Singular:**
each, every, either, neither, anyone, everyone, someone, nobody, nothing, one

✓ "Everyone HAS finished."
✓ "Each of the students HAS a book."

**Always Plural:**
both, few, many, several

**Can Be Either:**
all, any, most, none, some (depends on what they refer to)

## Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement

### Rule 1: Pronouns must match their antecedent in number
✓ "Each student should bring HIS OR HER book."
✗ "Each student should bring THEIR book." (traditionally incorrect on ACT)

### Rule 2: Collective nouns are singular
✓ "The team celebrated ITS victory."
✓ "The committee made ITS decision."

# ACT Math: Functions

Functions appear frequently on the ACT. Master these concepts!

## Function Basics

### Notation
f(x) = 2x + 3 means: substitute the input for x

f(5) = 2(5) + 3 = 13
f(a) = 2a + 3
f(x+1) = 2(x+1) + 3 = 2x + 5

### Domain and Range
- **Domain:** All possible INPUT values (x)
- **Range:** All possible OUTPUT values (y)

**Common domain restrictions:**
- Can't divide by zero
- Can't take square root of negative
- Can't take log of non-positive

## Function Operations

### Composition: (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x))
Work from inside out!

If f(x) = 2x and g(x) = x + 3:
(f ∘ g)(5) = f(g(5)) = f(8) = 16

### Inverse Functions: f⁻¹(x)
The inverse "undoes" the function.

If f(x) = 2x + 3, find f⁻¹(x):
1. Replace f(x) with y: y = 2x + 3
2. Swap x and y: x = 2y + 3
3. Solve for y: y = (x - 3)/2
4. f⁻¹(x) = (x - 3)/2

## Transformations

For f(x):
- f(x) + k: shifts UP by k
- f(x) - k: shifts DOWN by k
- f(x + h): shifts LEFT by h
- f(x - h): shifts RIGHT by h
- -f(x): reflects over x-axis
- f(-x): reflects over y-axis
- af(x): vertical stretch by a
- f(ax): horizontal compression by a

2. **Identify Weaknesses:** See which sections and question types need work.
3. **Develop Timing:** Learn to pace yourself under real conditions.
4. **Reduce Anxiety:** Familiarity breeds confidence.

## Mock Test Guidelines

### Before the Test
- Get a good night's sleep
- Eat a healthy breakfast
- Gather materials: pencils, calculator, timer
- Find a quiet space
- Turn off your phone

### During the Test
- Simulate real conditions
- Use official timing
- Don't pause between sections (except for scheduled breaks)
- Bubble your answers on an answer sheet

### After the Test
- Score your test
- Review EVERY wrong answer
- Identify patterns in your mistakes
- Create a study plan based on results

## Timing Reminders

### Enhanced ACT
| Section | Questions | Time |
|---------|-----------|------|
| English | 50 | 35 min |
| Math | 45 | 50 min |
| Reading | 36 | 40 min |

# The Step Method for ACT Reading

A systematic approach to maximize accuracy and efficiency.

## The 5 Steps

### Step 1: Preview the Passage (30 seconds)
- Read the blurb (introduction text)
- Note the passage type (Fiction, Social Science, etc.)
- Glance at paragraph structure

### Step 2: Read Actively (3-4 minutes)
- Underline key points
- Note author's tone
- Mark transitions and main ideas
- Don't get stuck on difficult parts

### Step 3: Attack Line-Number Questions First
- These have clear locations
- Go to the line BEFORE and AFTER for context
- Avoid answer traps

### Step 4: Answer Main Idea Questions Last
- Need full passage understanding
- Eliminate too-narrow or too-broad answers
- Should reflect the whole passage, not just parts

### Step 5: Eliminate Strategically
For each answer, ask:
- Is this supported by the text?
- Is this too extreme?
- Does this answer the actual question?

## Common Traps to Avoid

### The "Extreme" Trap
Words like "always," "never," "all," "none" are usually wrong.
**Prefer:** "often," "sometimes," "may," "might"

### The "Partially True" Trap
An answer that's half right is WRONG.

### The "Wrong Location" Trap
Information is in the passage—but doesn't answer THIS question.

### The "Same Words" Trap
Uses words from the passage but distorts the meaning.

Understanding question types helps you answer faster and more accurately.

## Category 1: Data Questions (40-50%)

### What They Ask
"According to Figure 1..."
"Based on Table 2..."
"What was the value when X = 10?"

### Strategy
1. Identify the figure/table mentioned
2. Locate the specific data point
3. Read the answer directly from the data
4. Don't overthink!

**Common Mistakes:**
- Reading the wrong axis
- Misreading units
- Looking at wrong figure

## Category 2: Bridge Questions (25-35%)

### What They Ask
"Based on Figure 1 AND Table 2..."
"According to the results of both experiments..."

### Strategy
1. Find the linking variable between sources
2. Use Figure 1 to get one value
3. Use that value in Table 2 to find your answer

**Example:**
Figure 1 shows temperature vs. time
Table 2 shows enzyme activity vs. temperature
Question asks: "At time = 5 min, what is enzyme activity?"
→ Use Figure 1 to find temp at 5 min
→ Use that temp in Table 2 to find activity

## Category 3: Experimental Design (10-15%)

### What They Ask
"Why did scientists control X?"
"What was the purpose of Trial 3?"
"Which hypothesis is supported?"

### Strategy
1. Understand the experimental setup
2. Identify independent, dependent, and controlled variables
3. Think about what the scientist was testing

## Category 4: Prior Knowledge (5-10%)

### What They Ask
Questions requiring basic science knowledge

### Topics to Know
- Basic chemistry (pH, atoms, molecules)
- Basic physics (force, energy, waves)
- Basic biology (cells, genetics, evolution)
- Lab safety and procedures

# ACT Math: Strategic Approaches

Learn when and how to use these powerful strategies.

## Strategy 1: Plugging In Numbers (PIN)

### When to Use
- Variables in answer choices
- "General" questions about relationships
- Word problems with unknowns

### How to Use
1. Choose simple numbers (2, 3, 5, 10)
2. Avoid 0, 1, and numbers in the problem
3. Plug into the question
4. Calculate your target answer
5. Plug into each answer choice
6. Find the match

**Example:**
If x is an even integer, which must be odd?
A) x + 2  B) 2x  C) x²  D) x + 1

Let x = 2:
A) 4 (even)  B) 4 (even)  C) 4 (even)  D) 3 (odd) ✓

## Strategy 2: Backsolving

### When to Use
- Numerical answer choices
- Question asks for a specific value
- Algebra looks complicated

### How to Use
1. Start with choice B or C (middle values)
2. Plug the answer into the problem
3. Check if it works
4. If not, determine if you need higher or lower

**Example:**
If 3x + 7 = 22, what is x?
A) 3  B) 5  C) 7  D) 9

Try B) x = 5: 3(5) + 7 = 22 ✓

## Strategy 3: Eyeballing (for Geometry)

### When to Use
- Diagrams drawn to scale
- Questions about length, area, or angle estimates

### How to Use
1. Compare unknown to known values
2. Eliminate obviously wrong answers
3. Make educated estimates

## Strategy 4: The Calculator

### Know Your Calculator
- Solve equations directly
- Graph functions
- Find intersections
- Calculate statistics

# Advanced Science: Conflicting Viewpoints

These passages present multiple hypotheses or viewpoints.

## Understanding the Format

### Structure
- Introduction: Background information
- Scientist 1/Student 1: First viewpoint
- Scientist 2/Student 2: Opposing viewpoint
- Sometimes 3+ viewpoints

### Key Differences from Data Passages
- More reading required
- Focus on understanding arguments
- Questions compare and contrast viewpoints

## Attack Strategy

### Step 1: Read the Introduction
Understand what question is being debated.

### Step 2: Summarize Each Viewpoint
After reading each viewpoint, write 1 sentence:
"Scientist 1 believes ___ because ___"
"Scientist 2 believes ___ because ___"

### Step 3: Identify Key Differences
What do they disagree about?
- The cause of something?
- The interpretation of data?
- The predicted outcome?

### Step 4: Answer Viewpoint-Specific Questions First
"According to Scientist 1..."
These are straightforward—just find the information.

### Step 5: Tackle Comparison Questions
"Both scientists would agree..."
"Scientist 1, but NOT Scientist 2, would..."

## Common Question Types

### Agreement Questions
Find common ground between viewpoints.

### New Information Questions
"If new evidence showed X, how would it affect...?"
Think about what each scientist would say.

### Weakness Questions
"Which finding would weaken Scientist 2's argument?"
Look for contradictions to their main claim.

# Advanced ACT Math Topics

These topics appear on harder questions (50-60).

## Complex Numbers

### Basics
i = √(-1)
i² = -1
i³ = -i
i⁴ = 1 (then pattern repeats)

### Finding Powers of i
Divide exponent by 4, use remainder:
- Remainder 0: i^n = 1
- Remainder 1: i^n = i
- Remainder 2: i^n = -1
- Remainder 3: i^n = -i

### Operations
(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i
(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i

## Matrices

### Addition/Subtraction
Add corresponding elements (matrices must be same size)

### Multiplication
Row × Column
[a b][e f]   [ae+bg  af+bh]
[c d][g h] = [ce+dg  cf+dh]

### Determinant (2×2)
|a b|
|c d| = ad - bc

## Logarithms

### Definition
log_a(x) = y means a^y = x

### Properties
- log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)
- log(x/y) = log(x) - log(y)
- log(x^n) = n·log(x)
- log_a(a) = 1
