Read the Full Sentence\nAlways read the entire sentence containing the underlined portion. Context is crucial.\n\n### 2. Economy Rule\n**Shorter is usually better** on the ACT—but check for:\n- Agreement errors\n- Missing essential meaning\n- Clarity issues\n\n### 3. NO CHANGE is Valid\nAbout 25% of answers are \"NO CHANGE.\" Don't be afraid to select it if the original is correct.\n\n### 4. Trust Your Ear (Sometimes)\nIf something sounds wrong, it often is.

The Dash Rule\nDashes come in PAIRS unless at the end of a sentence.\n\n✓ \"The dog—a golden retriever—ran away.\"\n✓ \"She finally arrived—exhausted but happy.\"\n\n**Test:** If you see one dash mid-sentence, look for its pair. If there's no pair, the answer is likely wrong.\n\n## 2. The 3-and-1 Rule\nWhen 3 answers share a feature and 1 is different, the different one is often correct.\n\n**Example:**\nA) quickly and efficiently moving\nB) moving quickly and efficiently\nC) moving with quickness and efficiency\nD) moving efficiently and quickly\n\nThree options start with \"moving\" → Choose a different structure (A)\n\n## 3. The DELETE Rule\nWhen \"DELETE the underlined portion\" is an option, give it serious consideration.\n\n**DELETE is often correct when:**\n- The underlined portion is redundant\n- It repeats information already stated\n- The sentence works perfectly without it\n\n## 4. The Who/Whom Rule\n- WHO = subject (he, she, they)\n- WHOM = object (him, her, them)\n\n**Quick Test:** Substitute he/him:\n- \"Who/Whom wrote this?\" → \"He wrote this\" → WHO\n- \"To who/whom should I send this?\" → \"Send to him\" → WHOM\n\n## 5. The Colon Rule\nColons require a complete sentence BEFORE them.\n\n✓ \"I need three things: paper, pen, and patience.\"\n✗ \"I need: paper, pen, and patience.\"\n    "

Word Choice Questions\nSelect the most appropriate word for context.\n\n**Consider:**\n- Tone (formal vs. casual)\n- Precision (vague vs. specific)\n- Connotation (positive vs. negative)\n\n### 3. Sentence Placement Questions\n\"For the sake of logic, Sentence X should be placed...\"\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. Read the sentence carefully\n2. Identify transition words or references\n3. Find where it logically fits (after what it references)\n\n### 4. NOT/EXCEPT Questions\n\"All of the following would be acceptable EXCEPT...\"\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. Test each answer individually\n2. Mark answers as ✓ (acceptable) or ✗ (not acceptable)\n3. The EXCEPT answer is the one that doesn't work\n\n**Tip:** These questions often test comma rules or word choice.\n    "

The Dash Rule\nDashes come in PAIRS unless at the end of a sentence.\n\n✓ \"The dog—a golden retriever—ran away.\"\n✓ \"She finally arrived—exhausted but happy.\"\n\n**Test:** If you see one dash mid-sentence, look for its pair. If there's no pair, the answer is likely wrong.\n\n## 2. The 3-and-1 Rule\nWhen 3 answers share a feature and 1 is different, the different one is often correct.\n\n**Example:**\nA) quickly and efficiently moving\nB) moving quickly and efficiently\nC) moving with quickness and efficiency\nD) moving efficiently and quickly\n\nThree options start with \"moving\" → Choose a different structure (A)\n\n## 3. The DELETE Rule\nWhen \"DELETE the underlined portion\" is an option, give it serious consideration.\n\n**DELETE is often correct when:**\n- The underlined portion is redundant\n- It repeats information already stated\n- The sentence works perfectly without it\n\n## 4. The Who/Whom Rule\n- WHO = subject (he, she, they)\n- WHOM = object (him, her, them)\n\n**Quick Test:** Substitute he/him:\n- \"Who/Whom wrote this?\" → \"He wrote this\" → WHO\n- \"To who/whom should I send this?\" → \"Send to him\" → WHOM\n\n## 5. The Colon Rule\nColons require a complete sentence BEFORE them.\n\n✓ \"I need three things: paper, pen, and patience.\"\n✗ \"I need: paper, pen, and patience.\"\n    "

Sentence Placement Questions\n\"For the sake of logic, Sentence X should be placed...\"\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. Read the sentence carefully\n2. Identify transition words or references\n3. Find where it logically fits (after what it references)\n\n### 4. NOT/EXCEPT Questions\n\"All of the following would be acceptable EXCEPT...\"\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. Test each answer individually\n2.

Identify the figure/table mentioned\n2. Locate the specific data point\n3. Read the answer directly from the data\n4. Don't overthink!\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n- Reading the wrong axis\n- Misreading units\n- Looking at wrong figure\n\n## Category 2: Bridge Questions (25-35%)\n\n### What They Ask\n\"Based on Figure 1 AND Table 2...\"\n\"According to the results of both experiments...\"\n\n### Strategy\n1. Find the linking variable between sources\n2. Use Figure 1 to get one value\n3. Use that value in Table 2 to find your answer\n\n**Example:**\nFigure 1 shows temperature vs. time\nTable 2 shows enzyme activity vs. temperature\nQuestion asks: \"At time = 5 min, what is enzyme activity?\"\n→ Use Figure 1 to find temp at 5 min\n→ Use that temp in Table 2 to find activity\n\n## Category 3: Experimental Design (10-15%)\n\n### What They Ask\n\"Why did scientists control X?\"\n\"What was the purpose of Trial 3?\"\n\"Which hypothesis is supported?\"\n\n### Strategy\n1. Understand the experimental setup\n2. Identify independent, dependent, and controlled variables\n3. Think about what the scientist was testing\n\n## Category 4: Prior Knowledge (5-10%)\n\n### What They Ask\nQuestions requiring basic science knowledge\n\n### Topics to Know\n- Basic chemistry (pH, atoms, molecules)\n- Basic physics (force, energy, waves)\n- Basic biology (cells, genetics, evolution)\n- Lab safety and procedures\n    "

Choose simple numbers (2, 3, 5, 10)\n2. Avoid 0, 1, and numbers in the problem\n3. Plug into the question\n4. Calculate your target answer\n5. Plug into each answer choice\n6. Find the match\n\n**Example:**\nIf x is an even integer, which must be odd?\nA) x + 2  B) 2x  C) x²  D) x + 1\n\nLet x = 2:\nA) 4 (even)  B) 4 (even)  C) 4 (even)  D) 3 (odd) ✓\n\n## Strategy 2: Backsolving\n\n### When to Use\n- Numerical answer choices\n- Question asks for a specific value\n- Algebra looks complicated\n\n### How to Use\n1. Start with choice B or C (middle values)\n2. Plug the answer into the problem\n3. Check if it works\n4. If not, determine if you need higher or lower\n\n**Example:**\nIf 3x + 7 = 22, what is x?\nA) 3  B) 5  C) 7  D) 9\n\nTry B) x = 5: 3(5) + 7 = 22 ✓\n\n## Strategy 3: Eyeballing (for Geometry)\n\n### When to Use\n- Diagrams drawn to scale\n- Questions about length, area, or angle estimates\n\n### How to Use\n1. Compare unknown to known values\n2. Eliminate obviously wrong answers\n3. Make educated estimates\n\n## Strategy 4: The Calculator\n\n### Know Your Calculator\n- Solve equations directly\n- Graph functions\n- Find intersections\n- Calculate statistics\n    "

Tense consistency\n\n### Punctuation\n1. Semicolons join independent clauses\n2. Colons require complete sentence before\n3. Apostrophes: possession vs. contraction\n\n### Word Choice\n1. Economy: shorter is usually better\n2. Precision: specific > vague\n3. Tone: match the passage style\n\n## Final Tips\n\n### Day Before\n- Review flashcards\n- Light practice only\n- Get good sleep\n\n### Test Day\n- Read carefully but efficiently\n- Trust your preparation\n- Don't panic on hard questions\n- Review if time permits\n\n### Mindset\n- You've prepared well\n- You know the strategies\n- Stay confident and focused\n    "
