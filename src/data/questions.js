    content: 'Which choice makes the sentence most grammatically acceptable?',
    prompt: 'The sentence is describing a specific time in the past—when Atala opened his restaurant in 1999.',
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'At first' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Initially' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'When' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'First' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: 'Using "When" clearly introduces the time-related clause and sets up the context for what follows. The original phrase "At first" incorrectly suggests a contrast or sequence of events, but the sentence isn\'t comparing two points in time or showing a shift; it\'s simply stating what happened at the time the restaurant opened. Options A, B, and D are either misleading or grammatically incomplete, while C correctly and clearly introduces the time clause.',
    strategyTips: 'For transition words, identify the relationship between ideas: time sequence, contrast, cause-effect, or addition.',

    category: 'Comma Questions',
    content: 'Which choice makes the sentence most grammatically acceptable?',
    prompt: 'Punctuating a list with em dashes.',
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'ingredients, such as manioc root,' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'ingredients—such as manioc root' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'ingredients such as manioc root' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'ingredients, such as, manioc root,' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'Em dashes are appropriate when inserting a break or interruption for emphasis, and here they neatly isolate the list of unusual ingredients, giving it the right emphasis without disrupting the sentence flow. Choice A (the original) is incorrect because the comma after "ingredients" followed by "such as," and then another comma after "manioc root" is unnecessary and awkward. Choice C lacks proper punctuation altogether, making the phrase confusing and grammatically incomplete. Choice D incorrectly adds a comma before "manioc root" and another after it, which makes it choppy and unclear.',
    strategyTips: 'Em dashes (—) can replace commas, parentheses, or colons to add emphasis to interrupting information.',

    questionNumber: 3,
    category: 'Category 3',
    content: 'The writer wants to emphasize the positive experience diners have at Atala\'s restaurant. Which choice best accomplishes that goal?',
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'thrilled (No Change)' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'mystified' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'shocked' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'startled' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'A',
    explanation: 'The word "thrilled" clearly conveys a strong, positive emotional reaction, which aligns perfectly with the writer\'s goal of emphasizing how much diners have enjoyed the experience. The other choices—"mystified," "shocked," and "startled"—are more neutral or even negative in tone. "Mystified" suggests confusion or wonder, which doesn\'t clearly indicate a positive feeling. "Shocked" and "startled" both carry negative or jarring connotations and don\'t fit the positive context of the sentence. "Thrilled" directly supports the idea of diners having a joyful, enthusiastic response.',
    strategyTips: 'For "accomplish goal" questions, identify the key words in the goal (here: "positive experience") and find the answer that most directly addresses those key words.',

    questionNumber: 4,
    category: 'Context',
    content: 'Given that all the choices are accurate, which one provides the best transition from the preceding paragraph to this paragraph?',
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Still, Atala felt he could do more for his country and its cuisine (No Change)' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Atala\'s restaurant became famous worldwide' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Many chefs have followed in Atala\'s footsteps' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Brazilian cuisine has a rich history' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'A',
    explanation: 'The phrase "Still, Atala felt he could do more for his country and its cuisine" works well as a transition because it builds directly on the previous paragraph\'s focus on Atala\'s success with his restaurant. The word "Still" signals a shift—it shows that even though Atala had achieved great things, he wasn\'t done yet. This leads logically into the next paragraph, which discusses how he went on to found Instituto Atá and further contribute to Brazil\'s culinary and environmental landscape. The other options, while accurate, are too specific or unrelated to the flow of the paragraph.',
    strategyTips: 'Transition questions require understanding both what came before AND what comes after. Look for logical flow.',

      { label: 'D', text: 'it\'s' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'A',
    explanation: 'The sentence is describing the tree dying once its (possessive) heart is removed, and "its" is the proper pronoun for showing ownership. Choice B uses "their," which is plural and doesn\'t match the singular subject "tree." Choice C incorrectly makes the subject plural ("trees") and still uses "its," creating disagreement. Choice D uses "it\'s," which is a contraction for "it is" or "it has," and is incorrect in this possessive context. Therefore, "its" in the original sentence is grammatically correct.',
    strategyTips: 'Remember: its = possessive (the tree\'s), it\'s = it is or it has. This is one of the most common ACT grammar traps.',

      { label: 'D', text: 'keep doling out' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'A',
    explanation: 'This wording is formal, neutral, and consistent with the informative and respectful tone of the essay. The passage discusses sustainability and environmental responsibility in a serious and objective style, and "live to yield" fits that tone perfectly. The other choices—"pull through and spawn," "continue to churn out," and "keep doling out"—are too casual or informal. "Pull through and spawn" sounds overly dramatic and biological, "churn out" implies mass production and lacks sensitivity, and "dole out" has a somewhat dismissive or mechanical tone.',
    strategyTips: 'Tone questions require matching the formality level of the passage. Academic passages need formal language.',

      { label: 'D', text: 'knowledge of local plants' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'D',
    explanation: 'This option is the most concise and clear version of the idea without repeating information unnecessarily. The original phrase "know-how they have" is vague and repetitive, since "know-how" already implies knowledge that someone possesses. Option B is overly wordy and repeats the idea of knowledge and knowing in an awkward way. Option C adds an unnecessary phrase "in the area," which is implied by the term "local plants." Only option D communicates the intended meaning efficiently and clearly, avoiding redundancy while staying on topic.',

      { label: 'D', text: 'centuries, using' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'D',
    explanation: 'This option correctly joins the noun "centuries" with the modifying phrase "using indigenous agricultural techniques." The original sentence "centuries that use" is incorrect because "centuries" (a measure of time) cannot logically "use" something. Option D eliminates that illogical construction and replaces it with a participial phrase that clearly and concisely describes the farming practices of the Baníwa women.',
    strategyTips: 'Watch for illogical constructions where non-human subjects are given human actions.',

      { label: 'C', text: 'are enabling' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'enable' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'This option matches the singular subject "Partnering," which is a gerund functioning as a singular noun. The sentence begins, "Partnering with Instituto Atá…" and refers to a singular action that has had an effect, so the correct verb form is the singular present perfect tense "has enabled." The original "have enabled" is incorrect because "have" is plural and doesn\'t agree with the singular subject. Options C ("are enabling") and D ("enable") are also incorrect for the same reason—they don\'t match the singular subject and do not maintain proper tense.',
    strategyTips: 'Gerunds (-ing words used as nouns) are always singular and take singular verbs: "Running is fun" not "Running are fun."',

      { label: 'C', text: 'dislocating' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'contorting' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'The sentence describes Alex Atala\'s work in promoting Brazil\'s native ingredients and reshaping the way people think about the country\'s food culture. The word "transforming" clearly and accurately conveys this idea of meaningful and positive change. The original word "deciphering" is less appropriate because it implies trying to interpret or decode something mysterious, which doesn\'t fit the context. Choices C and D ("dislocating" and "contorting") are even less relevant and introduce negative or confusing connotations.',

      { label: 'C', text: 'author, and dramatist,' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'author and dramatist' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'This option properly sets off the appositive phrase with commas. The phrase "a medieval author and dramatist" is additional, descriptive information about Hrosvitha, and it needs to be separated from the rest of the sentence with commas to maintain grammatical clarity. The original version lacks the second comma, which makes the sentence harder to follow. Option C incorrectly places a comma before "and," which is not needed between just two items. Option D omits commas entirely, which fails to set off the nonessential phrase.',
    strategyTips: 'Appositives (renaming phrases) that are nonessential must be set off by commas on BOTH sides.',

      { label: 'D', text: 'Gandersheim, an abbey' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'D',
    explanation: 'This option provides a grammatically correct and clear appositive that renames Gandersheim concisely. The phrase "an abbey" gives additional information about Gandersheim without creating a run-on or awkward sentence structure. The original version ("the abbey at Gandersheim, it was well known…") is a comma splice—two independent clauses incorrectly joined by a comma. Choices B and C also result in grammatically clumsy or run-on constructions. Only choice D correctly inserts the appositive to clarify what Gandersheim is.',

    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: 'This option maintains the formal, objective tone of the essay while clearly conveying the intended meaning. The essay uses academic and informative language throughout, and "allowed her to retain" matches that tone perfectly. The original phrase "made it okay for her to keep" is too casual and vague for the context. Choices B and D ("permitted her to hang on to" and "let her keep up") are also too informal or imprecise.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: 'The sentence explains that Hrosvitha\'s financial independence and lack of obligations to marry allowed her greater freedom than most women of her time. This makes "As a result," the most logical transition, showing that her independence was a consequence of the prior circumstance. The original choice "Nevertheless," as well as "On the other hand" and "In contrast," all imply contradiction, but there is no contrast between the ideas—they build on each other logically.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 'D',
    explanation: 'This option clearly signals that the two historical epics had different focuses. This directly answers the question\'s goal of showing that each epic dealt with separate subject matter. The original phrase ("about the court of Otto I and Gandersheim") is ambiguous and could be interpreted as describing both epics collectively. Choice B ("each focused on…") and C ("focusing on…as well as") also suggest the same or overlapping topics. Only D unambiguously divides the content into two distinct subjects.',

"Have been lulled" is also the correct verb form for the present perfect passive voice. Option B, "whom have," is incorrect because "whom" is used as an object, not a subject. Option C, "they have," breaks the grammatical structure. Option D, "whose," is a possessive pronoun and doesn\'t fit the context.',

    explanation: 'The sentence describes how the speaker momentarily stops worrying about work and other concerns after being comforted by the music and the moment with her children. "For now" effectively conveys the temporary nature of this relief, making it the most logical and precise transition. The other options don\'t match the tone or timing: "Until then" implies something that hasn\'t happened yet, "Now and then" suggests sporadic action, and "Later" implies a future event.',

The other options introduce dangling modifiers or awkward phrasing.

The sentence reads: "Also known as open storage, visible storage provides ways to display many items…" which is direct and properly constructed. The other choices introduce grammatical errors or awkward phrasing: "storage makes providing" is redundant and unclear, "storage, which provides" unnecessarily splits the clause, and "storage, providing" turns the main clause into a participial phrase, making the sentence incomplete.',

Traditional displays feature space between objects and individual labels, while visible storage displays place objects closer together and have fewer labels. The transition "Conversely" clearly signals this contrast in approach. "Subsequently" implies a sequence of time rather than contrast.
