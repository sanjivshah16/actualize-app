      "content": "# Comma Rules & Punctuation Guide\n\n## How to Recognize Comma Questions\n1. **Prompt**: Look for \"Which choice makes the sentence most grammatically acceptable\"\n2. **Conceptual**: Look for anything with punctuation (commas, periods, semicolons, etc.) in the underlined portion\n\n## The Order of Operations for Punctuation\nWhen approaching punctuation questions, try answers in this order:\n1. **Period** (separates two independent clauses)\n2. **Semicolon** (separates two independent clauses)\n3. **Dash** (can separate I-D)\n4. **Commas** (most to least)\n5. **Colon** (can follow independent clause)\n6. **No punctuation**\n\n---\n\n## The Four Essential Comma Tests\n\n### 1. The D&I (Dependent/Independent) Test\nIf a comma separates a dependent and independent clause, **keep the comma**. If a comma separates two dependents or two independents, **no comma** (unless FANBOYS).\n\n**Example**: \"Although I went to the store, I didn't buy anything.\"\n- \"Although I went to the store\" = dependent clause\n- \"I didn't buy anything\" = independent clause\n- ✓ Comma is correct\n\n**Common Dependent Clause Starters (WABBITS)**:\n- **W**: While, When, Whereas\n- **A**: After, Although, As, At\n- **B**: Before, Because\n- **B**: (part of pattern)\n- **I**: If, In\n- **T**: Though\n- **S**: Since\n\n**Tip**: If you can put \"It is\" or \"They are\" at the beginning of a clause, it's usually dependent.\n\n### 2. The Bracket Test\nIf the expression between two commas can be eliminated and the sentence still makes sense, then **keep both commas**.\n\n**Example**: \"The best player on the '86 Red Sox, who was also the best player in the entire league, was Wade Boggs.\"\n- Remove bracketed phrase: \"The best player on the '86 Red Sox was Wade Boggs.\" ✓\n- The sentence still works, so keep both commas.\n\n### 3. The Adjective List Test\nIf commas are between adjectives, apply the **And/Reverse Test**:\n- Can you replace the comma with \"and\"?\n- Can you reverse the adjectives with no loss of meaning?\n\nIf yes to both, **keep the comma**.\n\n**Example**: \"We love the big, friendly giant.\"\n- \"The big and friendly giant\" ✓\n- \"The friendly, big giant\" ✓\n- Keep the comma!\n\n### 4. The FANBOYS Test\nThe **only** situation where you can have a comma between two independent clauses is with FANBOYS:\n- **F**or\n- **A**nd\n- **N**or\n- **B**ut\n- **O**r\n- **Y**et\n- **S**o\n\n**Example**: \"I went to the store, and I bought some groceries.\"\n\n---\n\n## Punctuation Rules Chart\n\n| Condition | Period | Semicolon | Dash | D&I Comma | FANBOYS Comma | Colon |\n|-----------|--------|-----------|------|-----------|---------------|-------|\n| I-I (Independent-Independent) | ✓ | ✓ | | | ✓ | ✓ |\n| D-I (Dependent-Independent) | | | | ✓ | | |\n| I-D (Independent-Dependent) | | | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ |\n| D-D (Dependent-Dependent) | | | | | | |\n\n---\n\n## Magic Tricks & Shortcuts\n\n### The Dash Rule\nIf you have one dash in the sentence and they offer you a dash in the answer, **take it**.\n\n### Sundry Rules\n1. Two dashes = two commas = two parentheses\n2. Semicolons = periods (both separate two independent clauses)\n3. In a head-to-head match-up, always choose **colon over semicolon**\n4. **Never** put a D&I comma or opening bracket before a preposition\n5. For Title/Name situations, use the bracket rule + the \"Pronoun/Noun and A\" rule\n\n---\n\n## Common Comma Errors to Avoid\n\n### Comma Splices\nTwo independent clauses joined only by a comma = **ALWAYS WRONG**\n\n**Wrong**: \"I went to the store, I bought milk.\"\n**Right**: \"I went to the store, and I bought milk.\" (FANBOYS)\n**Right**: \"I went to the store; I bought milk.\" (Semicolon)\n\n### Unnecessary Commas\nDon't use commas to separate essential information that defines what you're talking about.\n\n**Wrong**: \"The book, that I read, was great.\"\n**Right**: \"The book that I read was great.\"\n"

If you can say \"They,\" it's plural.\n- She wants (singular)\n- They want (plural)\n\n---\n\n## Pronoun Agreement\n\n### General Rule\nMake pronouns consistent with the nearest noun before the pronoun. Always test!\n\n### Name Noun vs. Pronoun Rule\n**Always choose the name noun over the pronoun.**\n- Choose \"Jim\" over \"him\"\n- Choose \"the surface of the fabric\" over \"its surface\"\n- Choose \"Hindi Cinema\" over \"its cinema\"\n\n### Pronouns and Contractions\n| Word | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| It's | It is |\n| Its | Possessive |\n| Its' | DOESN'T EXIST |\n| Who's | Who is |\n| Whose | Possessive |\n\n---\n\n## Who vs. Whom (Magic Trick)\n\n**Simple Rule**:\n- **Who** goes before verbs\n- **Whom** goes before nouns\n- When in doubt, **choose Who over Whom**\n\n---\n\n## Modifier Rules\n\n### How to Recognize\nThe underline is usually at the **beginning of a sentence** or **after a comma** in a D-I phrase.\n\n### The Rule\nThe first word of the independent clause must refer to the first words of the dependent clause.\n\n**Example**: \"Trying to escape, the prisoner dug through the wall.\"\n- Who is trying to escape? The prisoner. ✓\n\n**Wrong**: \"Trying to escape, the wall was dug through by the prisoner.\"\n- The wall is not trying to escape!\n\n---\n\n## Apostrophe Rules\n\n### When to Use Apostrophes\nIf you can replace the word with \"my\" or \"their,\" it deserves an apostrophe.\n\n**Example**: \"Rilke's poetry\" = \"my poetry\" ✓\n\n### Possession Rules\n- Possession apostrophes precede nouns or adjectives then nouns\n- Otherwise, no apostrophe\n\n### Singular vs. Plural Possession\n- **Singular**: 's (My friend's house)\n- **Plural**: s' (My friends' houses)\n\n---\n\n## Commonly Confused Words\n\n### Affect vs. Effect\n- **Affect** = verb (\"How does inflation affect stock prices?\")\n- **Effect** = noun (\"The effect of inflation on stock prices...\")\n\n### Than vs. Then\n- **Than** = comparing things (\"They had more eggs than we did.\")\n- **Then** = time or following \"if\" (\"We went to the movies; then, we went home.\")\n\n### Passed vs. Past\n- **Passed** = verb, past tense of \"pass\" (\"She passed the test.\")\n- **Past** = not a verb, something behind you (\"We walked past the garbage can.\")\n\n### Began vs. Begun\n- We **began**. We **had begun**.\n- We drank. We had drunk.\n- We sank. We had sunk.\n\n### Cite vs. Site vs. Sight\n- **Cite** = verb, to reference (\"To cite a source\")\n- **Site** = a place (\"The site of my birthday party\")\n- **Sight** = ability to see (\"I noticed him by sight\")\n\n---\n\n## Tense Consistency\nMake verbs consistent with the tense of the closest verbs in the passage.\n"

It satisfies the rules of **agreement**\n2. It is **clear**\n3. It is **simple and formal**\n\nIf the shortest answer does NOT meet one of these rules, go to the next shortest answer—and keep going if necessary.\n\n---\n\n## Common Traps\n\n### 1. Agreement Trap\nSometimes the shortest answer has an agreement error. Check for:\n- Subject-verb agreement\n- Pronoun agreement\n- Tense consistency\n\n### 2. Clarity Trap\nUsually involves the **Name Noun/Pronoun Rule**:\n- If you have to choose between a name noun and a pronoun, **always choose the name noun**\n- \"Jim\" over \"him\"\n- \"The surface of the fabric\" over \"the surface of it\"\n\n**Remember**: Repetition is NOT always redundancy!\n\n---\n\n## Sundry Rules\n\n### 1. Name Noun Over Pronoun\nIf you must choose between name noun and pronoun, always choose name noun. It doesn't matter how many times \"Jim\" has been repeated—choose \"Jim\" over \"him.\"\n\n### 2. Rule of Specificity\nLonger answers that are **more descriptive** (and non-redundant) are better than shorter, less descriptive answers.\n\n### 3. General Rule of Economy\nBest answers are shorter **AS LONG AS** they are:\n- Clear\n- Simple/formal\n- Meet rules of agreement\n\n---\n\n## Examples of Redundancy\n\n### Redundant (Wrong)\n- \"knowledge that they possess and know\" (possess and know = same thing)\n- \"knowledge of local plants in the area\" (local = in the area)\n- \"in my personal opinion\" (opinions are personal by definition)\n- \"completely destroyed\" (destroyed is already complete)\n- \"past history\" (history is the past)\n- \"advance planning\" (planning is done in advance)\n\n### Concise (Correct)\n- \"knowledge of local plants\"\n- \"in my opinion\"\n- \"destroyed\"\n- \"history\"\n- \"planning\"\n\n---\n\n## Quick Strategy\n\n1. See \"redundancy\" in the question? → Go to shortest answer\n2. Check: Does it have agreement errors? → If yes, next shortest\n3. Check: Is it clear? → If no, next shortest\n4. Check: Is it formal? → If no, next shortest\n5. If all checks pass → That's your answer!\n"

      "content": "# Edit for Meaning (EMQ) & Comment for Meaning (CMQ) Guide\n\n## Edit for Meaning Questions (EMQs)\n\n### A. Key Word EMQs (Textual)\n\n**Recognize**: Look for a textual edit prompt in front of the question and edit in answers. Look for adjectives and adverbs like \"most descriptive,\" \"most specific,\" \"most precise,\" \"new,\" \"different,\" etc.\n\n**Approach**: Read the sentence carefully. Sometimes read the sentence before or after. Substitute answers in. Answer the question—do NOT worry about commas, agreement, economy. Just follow instructions.\n\n**Test**: The correct answer is very often the one that is **most specific and strongest** in language.\n\n### B. Location EMQs (Textual)\n\n**Recognize**: The prompt is about improving one part of the text by referencing another part.\n\n**Approach**:\n| Question Type | What to Read |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Best Introduction | Next sentence |\n| Best Conclusion | Previous sentence |\n| Most Relevant | Previous AND next sentence |\n| Best Conclusion to Passage | Title, intro, and previous sentence |\n| Best Transition From | Previous sentence |\n| Best Transition To | Next sentence |\n| Best Transition From AND To | Previous AND next sentence |\n\n**Test**: Look for the answer that is the **closest synonym** to the sentence(s) you just read. Use process of elimination.\n\n### C. NOT/EXCEPT EMQs\n\n**Recognize**: \"NOT\" or \"EXCEPT\" will be in ALL CAPS. If you don't see it, you can still recognize it if more than one answer seems correct.\n\n**Approach/Test**:\n- The correct answer will usually be the one that **doesn't look like the other three**\n- **95%** of NOT/EXCEPT questions are Comma questions in disguise\n- **70%** have two independent clauses separated by a comma as the correct answer\n\n---\n\n## Comment for Meaning Questions (CMQs)\n\n### A. Yes/No Explanation Questions\n\n**Recognize**: Long answers. CMQs are about the whole paragraph or whole passage. Often phrased as:\n- \"The writer is thinking about adding/deleting the following. Should she?\"\n- \"A good conclusion that reiterates the main point would be...\"\n- \"This passage is about X. Yes/No and why?\"\n\n**Approach**:\n- For whole passage questions: Re-read the **passage title, introduction, and conclusion**\n- For whole paragraph questions: Read **current paragraph** and **last sentence of previous paragraph** and **first sentence of next paragraph**\n\n**Test**:\n1. Start with the **explanation first**\n2. Only after you've done POE for explanation, go to Yes/No\n3. Two answers will usually be **internally inconsistent** (wrong because they don't answer the question)\n\n### B. \"If the Writer Were to Delete\" Questions\n\n**Recognize**: \"If the writer were to delete the previous sentence, the paragraph/passage would lose...\"\n\n**Approach/Test**:\n- The answer is most likely a **summary of the information** in the deleted text\n- Answer is UNLIKELY to be \"deleting it won't change the meaning\"\n- These questions rarely ask about sentences that should be deleted\n\n**Strategy**: Read context WITH the sentence and WITHOUT the sentence. Observe the difference.\n\n### C. Sequence Questions\n\n**Recognize**: \"Sentence Five would best be placed...after sentence 2, before sentence 1, where it is now, after sentence 4.\"\n\n**Approach**: The most important words are:\n- **Articles** (a, an, the)\n- **Pronouns** (he, she, it, they)\n- **Context words**\n- **Repetitions**\n\n**Example**: \"He did not bend the rules, after all.\"\n- \"He\" → Who is \"he\"? Previous sentence should introduce him\n- \"the rules\" → What rules? Previous sentence should mention rules\n- \"after all\" → Previous sentence should suggest he was considering breaking rules\n\n**Test**: Plug the sentence into Answer A first. Look for:\n- Repeated noun words\n- Nouns that explain pronouns\n- Contextual words\n\nOften, the giveaway is a **noun at the end of one sentence** and **the same noun at the beginning of the next**.\n\n### D. \"The Writer is Considering Adding\" Questions\n\n**Magic Trick**:\n- If adding a **full sentence** → Answer is almost always **\"No\"**\n- If adding **part of a sentence** → Answer is almost always **\"Yes\"**\n\n### E. \"The Writer is Considering Revising\" Questions\n\n**Magic Trick**:\n- If revision makes sentence **more specific** → \"Yes\"\n- If revision makes sentence **less specific** → \"No\"\n\n### F. Main Idea Questions\n\n**Approach**:\n- For whole passage: Read title, intro, last sentence of intro, and conclusion\n- Pay attention to the **grammatical subject** of sentence(s)—it tells you what/whom the excerpt is about\n"

      "content": "# ACT Reading: The Krupnick Approach\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### General > Specific\nWhen in doubt, choose the more general answer over the overly specific one.\n\n### Positive > Negative\nPrefer positive interpretations unless the passage is clearly negative.\n\n### Moderate > Extreme\nAvoid extreme language. The ACT prefers moderate, balanced answers.\n\n---\n\n## Reading Methods (Choose Your Approach)\n\n### Method 1: Line Numbers First (Recommended)\n1. Do line number questions first\n2. Then do other questions looking for keywords\n3. Do NOT read the entire passage first\n\n### Method 2: Skim + Line Numbers\n1. Skim the passage quickly\n2. Do line number questions first\n3. Return to passage for other questions\n\n### Method 3: Line Numbers → Skim → Others\n1. Do line number questions\n2. Then skim the passage\n3. Then answer remaining questions\n\n### Method 4: Traditional\nRead thoroughly and answer questions sequentially (only for very strong readers)\n\n---\n\n## What to Look For When Reading\n\n1. **Main idea/purpose** - What is this passage about?\n2. **Point of view** - Who/what is being talked about?\n3. **Characters and quotations** - Who said what?\n4. **Technical terms** - Specialized vocabulary\n5. **Tone** - Is it positive or negative?\n6. **Argument vs. Description** - Is the author making a point or just describing?\n7. **Title/Background** - ALWAYS read these!\n\n---\n\n## Question Types\n\n### A. Content Categories\n\n#### 1. Detail Questions (Explicit)\n- Answer is directly stated in the passage\n- Look for exact words or paraphrases\n\n#### 2. Inference Questions (Implicit)\n- Answer is implied, not stated\n- Uses words like \"infer,\" \"imply,\" \"suggests\"\n- Still must be supported by text!\n\n#### 3. Purpose Questions\n- About the author's intent\n- Often has a very general answer\n- Ask: \"Why did the author write this?\"\n\n#### 4. Main Idea Questions\n- (Re)read Title, intro, conclusion\n- Look for recurring themes\n\n### B. Method Categories\n\n#### 1. Line Number Questions\n- The question gives you specific line numbers\n- Go directly to those lines\n- Read a few lines before and after\n\n#### 2. Keyword Questions\n- Contains a number or rare capitalized word\n- Search for that specific term in the passage\n- Rare capital letters appear only once or twice\n\n#### 3. Non-Keyword Questions\n- Usually main idea or open-ended\n- Try to remember where topic appeared\n- Use topic sentences (first sentence of paragraphs)\n\n---\n\n## Traps and Answer Patterns\n\n### A. One-Word Answer Trap\nWatch for one word (or a few words) that throws off an otherwise correct answer. Two answers seem close? Check for that one wrong word.\n\n### B. Same-Word Trap\nJust because an answer uses the same word as the passage doesn't mean it's correct!\n\n### C. Part/Whole Trap\nThe answer is either:\n- Too general (whole instead of part)\n- Too specific (part instead of whole)\n\n### D. Positive/Negative Trap\nYou get the wrong valence—chose negative when it should be positive, or vice versa.\n\n### E. Rule of Inclusivity\nA more inclusive answer that covers more ground is often better.\n\n### F. Describe vs. Prescribe Trap\n- **Describe** = explain what IS\n- **Prescribe** = explain what SHOULD BE\nMake sure you know which one the passage is doing!\n\n### G. Opposite Trap\nThe answer is the exact opposite of what the passage says.\n\n### H. Extreme Answers\n**Avoid extreme language!**\n- Words like \"always,\" \"never,\" \"all,\" \"none,\" \"completely\"\n- ACT prefers moderate, qualified language\n\n---\n\n## Categories of Reading Answers\n\nWhen comparing answer choices, consider:\n\n1. **Subject** - Who or what is being talked about?\n2. **Singular/Plural** - Individual or groups?\n3. **Study vs. Thing** - Study of the thing vs. the thing itself?\n4. **Behavior vs. Attitudes** - What they do vs. what they think?\n5. **Direction vs. Magnitude** - Which way vs. how much?\n6. **Positive vs. Negative** - Good or bad connotation?\n"

      "content": "# ACT Math Problem-Solving Strategies\n\n## The Four Dimensions of ACT Math\n\n1. **Content Knowledge** - Do you know the math?\n2. **Technique** - Can you apply the right approach?\n3. **Speed** - Can you work fast enough?\n4. **Accuracy** - Can you avoid careless mistakes?\n\n---\n\n## Strategy 1: Plugging In Numbers (PIN)\n\n### When to Use\n- Variables in the answer choices\n- \"What is the value of x in terms of y\"\n- Word problems with no specific numbers\n\n### How to Do It\n1. Choose easy numbers (like 2, 3, 5, 10)\n2. Avoid 0 and 1 (too special)\n3. Work through the problem with your numbers\n4. Check which answer choice gives you the same result\n\n### Example\n\"If x is a positive integer, which expression equals 2x + 4?\"\n- Let x = 3\n- 2(3) + 4 = 10\n- Check each answer with x = 3 to find which = 10\n\n---\n\n## Strategy 2: Backsolving\n\n### When to Use\n- Numerical answer choices\n- \"Find the value of x\" type questions\n- When algebra seems complicated\n\n### How to Do It\n1. Start with answer choice C (middle value)\n2. Plug it back into the problem\n3. If too big, try smaller; if too small, try bigger\n4. You'll find the answer in 2-3 tries max\n\n---\n\n## Strategy 3: Eyeballing/Estimation\n\n### When to Use\n- Geometry problems with diagrams\n- \"Which is closest to...\" questions\n- When answers are spread far apart\n\n### How to Do It\n1. Use the diagram (if drawn to scale)\n2. Estimate sizes, angles, lengths\n3. Eliminate obviously wrong answers\n4. Make an educated guess\n\n### Caution\nIf the problem says \"not drawn to scale,\" be careful!\n\n---\n\n## Strategy 4: Working Backwards\n\n### When to Use\n- Multi-step word problems\n- When the end result is given\n\n### How to Do It\n1. Start with what you're looking for\n2. Work backwards through the problem\n3. Use the given information to check your work\n\n---\n\n## Calculator Strategies\n\n### When to Use Calculator\n- Long calculations\n- Graphing to check intersections\n- Checking work on algebra\n\n### When NOT to Use Calculator\n- Simple arithmetic (faster by hand)\n- Conceptual questions\n- When the numbers are clearly designed to simplify\n\n### Calculator Tips\n- Practice with YOUR calculator before test day\n- Know where the functions are\n- Use parentheses to avoid order of operations errors\n\n---\n\n## Time Management\n\n### Question Distribution\n- Questions 1-20: Easier (1 min each)\n- Questions 21-40: Medium (1-1.5 min each)\n- Questions 41-60: Harder (1.5-2 min each)\n\n### If Stuck\n- Skip and come back\n- Make an educated guess\n- Never leave blank!\n\n---\n\n## Common Careless Mistakes\n\n1. **Sign errors** - Watch positive/negative\n2. **Distribution errors** - Distribute to ALL terms\n3. **Fraction errors** - Remember common denominators\n4. **Unit conversions** - Check units match\n5. **Reading errors** - Answer what they ASKED\n6. **Calculator entry** - Double-check what you typed\n\n### Prevention\n- Read the question twice\n- Underline what they're asking for\n- Check your answer makes sense\n- Re-read before moving on\n\n---\n\n## \"When You See\" Shortcuts\n\n| When You See | Think |\n|--------------|-------|\n| Parallel lines | Alternate interior angles equal |\n| Midpoint | Distance formula or average |\n| \"In terms of\" | Plug in numbers |\n| Remainder | Try actual division |\n| Percent increase | New = Original × (1 + rate) |\n| System of equations | Add/subtract or substitute |\n"

      "content": "# ACT Science Strategies\n\n## The Truth About ACT Science\n\n**It's NOT really a science test!**\n\nACT Science is primarily a test of:\n- Reading comprehension\n- Data interpretation\n- Logical reasoning\n\nYou do NOT need to memorize scientific facts. Everything you need is in the passages.\n\n---\n\n## Passage Types\n\n### 1. Data Representation (30-40%)\n- Graphs, tables, and charts\n- Focus on reading the data\n- Questions ask you to interpret trends\n\n### 2. Research Summaries (45-55%)\n- Descriptions of experiments\n- Multiple studies or experiments\n- Compare methods and results\n\n### 3. Conflicting Viewpoints (15-20%)\n- Two or more scientists with different views\n- Usually 1 passage per test\n- Compare and contrast opinions\n\n---\n\n## General Strategy\n\n### Step 1: Skim the Passage (30-60 seconds)\n- Read intro paragraph\n- Look at figures/tables\n- Note what's being measured\n- DON'T read every word\n\n### Step 2: Go to the Questions\n- Most answers are in the figures\n- Read questions carefully\n- Find the relevant data\n\n### Step 3: Answer & Move On\n- Don't overthink\n- Trust the data\n- Keep moving\n\n---\n\n## Reading Figures\n\n### Tables\n- Read column headers first\n- Note units\n- Look for patterns (increasing? decreasing?)\n\n### Graphs\n- Read axis labels and units\n- Identify variables (x = independent, y = dependent)\n- Note the scale\n- Look for trends\n\n### Key Questions\n- What's being measured?\n- What are the variables?\n- What's the trend?\n- Are there outliers?\n\n---\n\n## Question Types & Strategies\n\n### Type 1: Find the Data\n- Locate the right figure\n- Find the specific value\n- Answer directly from data\n\n### Type 2: Identify Trends\n- Look at the overall pattern\n- Is it increasing, decreasing, or constant?\n- Is the relationship direct or inverse?\n\n### Type 3: Compare Experiments\n- What's the same?\n- What's different?\n- Why did results differ?\n\n### Type 4: Apply Information\n- Use data to predict new scenarios\n- Extend trends\n- Apply scientific reasoning\n\n### Type 5: Conflicting Viewpoints\n- Understand each scientist's position\n- Find where they agree/disagree\n- Answer based on THEIR view, not yours\n\n---\n\n## Conflicting Viewpoints Strategy\n\n### Step 1: Read the Introduction\n- What's the question/debate?\n- What are they trying to explain?\n\n### Step 2: Read Scientist 1's View\n- What do they believe?\n- What's their main evidence?\n\n### Step 3: Read Scientist 2's View\n- What do they believe?\n- How does it differ from Scientist 1?\n\n### Step 4: Answer Questions\n- \"According to Scientist 1...\" → Only use Scientist 1's info\n- \"Both scientists would agree...\" → Find common ground\n- \"Which observation would weaken...\" → Find contradicting evidence\n\n---\n\n## Time Management\n\n- **6-7 passages** in **35 minutes**\n- About **5 minutes per passage**\n- 40 questions total\n\n### Prioritize\n1. Do Data Representation passages first (easiest)\n2. Then Research Summaries\n3. Save Conflicting Viewpoints for last (most reading)\n\n### If Stuck\n- Skip and come back\n- Eliminate obviously wrong answers\n- Make educated guess\n- NEVER leave blank\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n1. **Reading too much** - Skim passages, focus on data\n2. **Ignoring units** - Always check units!\n3. **Wrong figure** - Make sure you're looking at the right one\n4. **Overthinking** - The answer is usually straightforward\n5. **Outside knowledge** - Only use what's in the passage\n6. **Rushing Conflicting Viewpoints** - This passage type requires more reading\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference: What to Look For\n\n| In Tables | In Graphs |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Column headers | Axis labels |\n| Row labels | Units |\n| Units | Scale |\n| Trends in columns | Shape of curve |\n| Patterns across rows | Intersections |\n"
